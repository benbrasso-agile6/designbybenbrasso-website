            Hello! I’m Ben Brasso, a UX Designer and Product Strategist with a knack for transforming complex
            challenges into intuitive and engaging digital solutions. My approach is rooted in empathy, understanding
            user needs, and aligning them with business goals to create products that are not only functional but also
            delightful to use.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 md:text-lg mb-4">
            With several years of experience in the field, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of
            projects, from e-commerce platforms to mobile applications and SaaS products. I thrive in collaborative
            environments and enjoy every stage of the design process, from initial research and ideation to
            prototyping and user testing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 md:text-lg">
            When I’m not designing, you can find me exploring new technologies, sketching ideas, or enjoying the great
            outdoors.
