          Revamped a complex B2B AI Scribe KPI dashboard to enhance data visualization, improve user workflow efficiency
          for medical scribes and administrators, and provide more actionable insights into scribe performance and
          documentation quality.
        </p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          The existing dashboard for AI scribe performance was data-rich but suffered from information overload and a
          lack of clear hierarchy. Users found it difficult to quickly identify key performance indicators, track
          documentation accuracy, and perform essential administrative tasks, leading to underutilization of the
          platformâ€™s capabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role & Process</h2>
        <p>As the UX strategist and designer, my responsibilities included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Analysis & User Feedback:</strong> Analyzed usage data and collected feedback from existing
            clients to understand their primary goals and pain points.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Workflow Optimization:</strong> Mapped out existing user workflows and identified areas for
            improvement and simplification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information Prioritization:</strong> Worked with product managers to define key performance
            indicators (KPIs) and prioritize information display.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Visualization Design:</strong> Explored various charting and data visualization techniques to
            present complex data in an understandable and actionable manner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Iterative Design & Prototyping:</strong> Created wireframes and interactive prototypes, iterating
            based on stakeholder and user feedback.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features & Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Customizable Dashboard Widgets:</strong> Allowed users to personalize their dashboard view by
            selecting and arranging relevant data widgets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Data Visualization:</strong> Implemented clearer charts, graphs, and data tables with
            better labeling and context.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Highlighted key trends, anomalies, and provided contextual
            recommendations.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scribe Performance Metrics:</strong> Clear visualization of individual and team scribe efficiency
            and accuracy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
        <p>The optimized dashboard resulted in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>30% increase in user engagement with key dashboard features.</li>
